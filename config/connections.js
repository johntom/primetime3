/**
 * Connections
 * 
 * The `connections` configuration object lets you create different global "saved settings"
 * that you can mix and match in your models.  The `default` option indicates which 
 * "saved setting" should be used if a model doesn't have a connection specified.
 *
 * Note: If you're using version control, you should put your passwords/api keys 
 * in `config/local.js`, not here, in case you inadvertently push them up to your repository.
 *
 * For more information on configuration, check out:
 * http://sailsjs.org/#documentation
